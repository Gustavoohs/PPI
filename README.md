##
The Pixel Purity Index (PPI) is an algorithm used in images to identify pure pixels, i.e. pixels that represent a single type of material in the scene. The central idea is to rotate the data set and check how many times each pixel appears at the edges of the attribute space. The output is an image with the number of times each pixel has been on the edges.
